Possible ways we could fail to recognize an author has published for as long as they actually have
\begin{itemize}
\item{If someone simultaneously changes institution and area of study}
  \item{If an astronomer leaves the field for an extended time and re-joins in a different field}
\item{If an astronomer changes their name (although authors can notify ADS of name changes)}
  \item{}
\end{itemize}

Ways we could mistakenly claim an author has published for longer than they actually have
\begin{itemize}
\item{If two authors have similar names and overlap at the same institution}
\item{If two authors have similar names and similar reference lists in their papers}
  \item{If two authors have similar names and similarly named co-authors}
\end{itemize}

The overall point is that errors can happen both ways and both should be relavively rare, giving us a more accurate measurement of astronomer career lifetimes than survey results which rarely top XXX\% response rates.
